How to start project: 

- Run "npm init" initialse and create package.json (config file)
- index.js is the entry point, this file is the server
- in the terminal, run "node index.js" to run the index.js file in the node runtime

What is a server?

A server is an application that runs and listens for requests, people that want to connect to the server.
The server acts as the central repository of the data of the application.
In Node.js, Express.js is used as a web framework and to initialise a server

 What are the purposes of Servers?

 1) Serve web pages for client

Install Express

- Run "npm install express" to install Express.js
- node_modules will be downloaded to allow Express.js to function, as Express.js has dependencies that require it to run
- package.json will update to include express.js as a dependency
- package-lock.json will be created which keeps track of dependencies and versions of all packages
- Time to code in index.js!!

How to set-up Express server in index.js

const express = require("express"); - import express into index.js

const app = express(); - initialise express and store it in app variable

app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Port 3000 is listening for requests"));
 
 - servers need to listen for requests, so we need to call .listen(). 3000 is the port used so its passed in as a parameter (ports are logical endpoints of a network connect that is used to exchange information between a web server and a web client)

 - Second parameter is callback function which executes once request is made by client

Serving index.html file to client from server

Error will pop up "Cannot GET /" as the server is not hosting any html folder to the client, despite the fact the connection has been setup 

- Use express to host static files
- Create public folder to hold static files (anything in public folder is accessible for the client)

app.use(express.static('public'));

- Now Express will serve to the client the index.html file thats in the public folder
